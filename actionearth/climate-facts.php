<strong>A 2C&#176; rise in temperature is considered to be the <a href='tipping-point.php'>TIPPING POINT</a>. Beyond 2C&#176; a breakdown in the Earth's natural systems will result in runaway global warming. At this point even our best efforts to reduce CO2 will be meaningless.</strong>

<h3>Climate Change Facts</h3>

<ul>

<li>The Earth has warmed by 0.7C&#176; since the start of the industrial revolution in 1750.</li>

<li>There is enough greenhouse gas already in the atmosphere to cause a further 0.6C&#176; rise. This can be described as a lag effect.</li>

<li>A 2C&#176; rise in temperature is considered to be the <a href='tipping-point.php'>tipping point</a> beyond which a runaway greenhouse effect would ensue. Humankind would have no control beyond this point. </li>

<li>The <a href='world-food-shortage.php'>world food shortage</a> and <a href='species-extinction.php'>species extinction</a> time-bombs may already be ticking.</li>

<li>The recently discovered phenomenon of <a href='global-dimming.php'>Global Dimming</a> suggests that scientists may have underestimated the full effect of Global Warming. The <a href='tipping-point.php'>tipping point</a> of 2C&#176; may have to be revised downwards. </li>

<li>A runaway greenhouse effect could be caused by a number of natural phenomena creating <a href='positive-feedback-loops.php'>positive feedback loops</a> in the earth climate system. The effect of any of these natural phenomena is to amplify global warming. </li>

<li>The <a href='gulf-stream.php'>Gulf Stream</a>, the warm current responsible for the temperate climate of N Europe and the US is in danger of switching off. Already it is 10% smaller in size. This does not take into account the lag effect of more recent greenhouse gases which have yet to impact on ice sheets and sea temperatures. </li>
