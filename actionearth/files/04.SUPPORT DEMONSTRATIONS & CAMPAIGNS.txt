   WHAT IF I SUPPORT DEMONSTRATIONS & CAMPAIGNS?

         You will be adding your presence and energy whist linking 
                  up with likeminded people and organisations.
                                                       

Historic demonstrations have included; 
CND marches which raised mass awareness of the implications of nuclear war.
American Civil Rights marches which resulted in the end of segregation in 1960's America.
The Suffragette movement finally resulted in the women's vote..
The anti-apartheid movement finally ending segregation in South Africa.
Stop the War marches of 2003 which, although weren't successful in stopping Britain joining the US in invading Iraq, did raise massive awareness of the issue; one which has dogged the Labour Government ever since.  

Demonstrating against Government policies which turn a blind eye or even support Global Warming is the most important action of our time. In 10 years scientists predict that with increasing emission levels we will reach the tipping point, triggering a runaway greenhouse effect over which we will have no control.

THE NEXT MASS DEMONSTRATION IS ON SATURDAY 12 FEBRUARY 2005 to protest against the US and Australia's boycott of the Kyoto agreement which becomes law for 35 countries on February16th.
MEET AT  LINCOLN'S INN FIELD AT 11.30am. Nearest Tube Station is HOLBORN
