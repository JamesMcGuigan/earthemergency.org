<h3 class="first">Buy Locally Grown Organic Foods</h3>

<p>A major source of emissions result from imported foods transported by air. The distance a food item has travelled between farmer and food store is known as its "food miles". Supermarkets are required now to make information regarding the country of origin of fresh foods available to the consumer. However a way around this is to refer shoppers to a website - not very useful when you're out shopping!</p>

<p>One way to reduce food miles is to take part in a "box scheme". Available now in many parts of the country, such schemes offers organic, locally produced fruits and vegetables delivered to your door. It's well worthwhile supporting these sustainable initiatives such as <a href='http://www.abel-cole.co.uk/'>Able & Cole</a> in the UK.</p>
